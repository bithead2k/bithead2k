I'm Kirk Roybal.   The only Kirk Roybal known to exist.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several things.   

### PostgreSQL raspberry pi bramble
This unit will consist of 7 raspberry pi 4 machines with 4GB each.  There will be a controller unit, a primary, 2 physical streaming replicants, 2 logical streaming replicants, zabbix monitoring, repmgr replication manager and barman backup.  It will all be strung together with ansible.

In the bramble, I will have a partitioned table of sensor data.  The data will be provided by a sense hat attached to the controller node.

I'll be using this bramble to teach PostgreSQL setup and monitoring in my courses, that I provide for 2ndQuadrant.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
###Python, ansible and raspberry pi things.


## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with and collaboration on
psql + powerline.   The psql client is basically a readline client, so it should be relatively easy to integrate powerline into it, and have a much more beautiful client experience.
